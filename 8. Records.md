### Records in Dart

Records, introduced in Dart 3.0, are immutable aggregate types used to bundle multiple values into a single object. They are distinct from other collection types because they are fixed-sized, heterogeneous, and typed. Records are useful for encapsulating multiple values, especially when returning multiple values from functions or for structured data storage.

#### Record Syntax

- **Positional Fields:** Defined within parentheses and accessed using positional getters.
  ```dart
  var record = ('first', 2, true, 'last');
  ```

- **Named Fields:** Defined with curly braces and accessed using field names.
  ```dart
  var record = (a: 2, b: true, name: 'John');
  ```

- **Type Annotations:** Specify types for records using positional and named fields.
  ```dart
  (String, int) record = ('A string', 123);
  ({int age, String name}) person = (age: 30, name: 'Alice');
  ```

#### Record Fields

- **Accessing Fields:** Use built-in getters to access record fields. Positional fields are accessed with `$<position>`, and named fields are accessed with their name.
  ```dart
  var record = ('first', a: 2, b: true, 'last');

  print(record.$1); // Prints 'first'
  print(record.a); // Prints 2
  print(record.b); // Prints true
  print(record.$2); // Prints 'last'
  ```

- **Field Types:** Each field in a record has its own type, which Dart’s type system understands for accurate type checking.
  ```dart
  (num, Object) pair = (42, 'a');
  var first = pair.$1; // Static type `num`, runtime type `int`.
  var second = pair.$2; // Static type `Object`, runtime type `String`.
  ```

#### Record Types

- **Structural Typing:** Records are structurally typed based on their fields’ types and names. Records with different names but identical field types are considered the same type.
  ```dart
  ({int x, int y}) point = (x: 1, y: 2);
  ({int a, int b}) location = (a: 3, b: 4);

  point = location; // OK, because the types match.
  ```

- **Named Fields:** In record type annotations, named fields can be used for documentation but do not affect type compatibility.
  ```dart
  (int a, int b) coordinates = (1, 2);
  (int x, int y) point = (3, 4);

  coordinates = point; // OK, names do not affect type compatibility.
  ```

#### Record Equality

- **Equality Check:** Two records are considered equal if they have the same shape and their corresponding fields have equal values. Named field order does not affect equality.
  ```dart
  (int x, int y, int z) point = (1, 2, 3);
  (int a, int b, int c) color = (1, 2, 3);

  print(point == color); // Prints 'true'.
  ```

- **Different Field Names:** Records with different named fields are considered different types and cannot be directly compared.
  ```dart
  ({int x, int y}) point = (x: 1, y: 2);
  ({int a, int b}) color = (a: 1, b: 2);

  print(point == color); // Prints 'false'.
  ```

#### Multiple Returns

- **Returning Multiple Values:** Records enable returning multiple values from functions in a structured manner.
  ```dart
  (String name, int age) userInfo(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return (json['name'] as String, json['age'] as int);
  }

  final json = <String, dynamic>{
    'name': 'Dash',
    'age': 10,
  };

  var (name, age) = userInfo(json); // Destructuring
  ```

- **Destructuring:** Use pattern matching to extract values from records. This can be done using positional fields or named fields.
  ```dart
  ({String name, int age}) userInfo(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return (name: json['name'] as String, age: json['age'] as int);
  }

  final (:name, :age) = userInfo(json); // Named fields destructuring
  ```

#### Additional Information

- **Records vs. Other Types:** Records are beneficial for functions returning multiple values, providing better type safety and structure compared to other types like `List` or `Map`.
