### Dart Language Special Support

Dart has special support for the following data types:

- **Numbers** (`int`, `double`)
- **Strings** (`String`)
- **Booleans** (`bool`)
- **Records** (`(value1, value2)`)
- **Lists** (`List`, also known as arrays)
- **Sets** (`Set`)
- **Maps** (`Map`)
- **Runes** (`Runes`, often replaced by the characters API)
- **Symbols** (`Symbol`)
- **The value `null`** (`Null`)

#### Literals and Constructors
Dart supports creating objects using literals. For example, `'this is a string'` is a string literal, and `true` is a boolean literal. Since every variable in Dart refers to an object (an instance of a class), you can usually use constructors to initialize variables. For instance, you can use the `Map()` constructor to create a map.

### Special Roles of Some Types
In addition to the built-in types, Dart has types with special roles:

- **Object:** The superclass of all Dart classes except `Null`.
- **Enum:** The superclass of all enums.
- **Future** and **Stream:** Used in asynchrony support.
- **Iterable:** Used in `for-in` loops and synchronous generator functions.
- **Never:** Indicates that an expression can never successfully finish evaluating, often used for functions that always throw an exception.
- **dynamic:** Disables static checking; usually, you should use `Object` or `Object?` instead.
- **void:** Indicates that a value is never used, often used as a return type.

The `Object`, `Object?`, `Null`, and `Never` classes have special roles in the class hierarchy. For more details, see "Understanding null safety."

### Numbers in Dart

Dart numbers come in two flavors:

- **`int`:** Integer values no larger than 64 bits. On native platforms, values range from `-2^63` to `2^63 - 1`. On the web, integer values are represented as JavaScript numbers (64-bit floating-point values with no fractional part) and range from `-2^53` to `2^53 - 1`.
- **`double`:** 64-bit (double-precision) floating-point numbers, as specified by the IEEE 754 standard.

Both `int` and `double` are subtypes of `num`, which includes basic operators such as `+`, `-`, `/`, and `*`, and methods like `abs()`, `ceil()`, and `floor()`. Bitwise operators (e.g., `>>`, `<<`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) are defined in the `int` class.

#### Integer and Double Examples

**Defining integer literals:**
```dart
var x = 1;
var hex = 0xDEADBEEF;
```

**Defining double literals:**
```dart
var y = 1.1;
var exponents = 1.42e5;
```

**Using `num` type:**
```dart
num x = 1; // x can have both int and double values
x += 2.5;
```

**Automatic conversion of integer literals to doubles:**
```dart
double z = 1; // Equivalent to double z = 1.0.
```

**Converting between strings and numbers:**
```dart
// String -> int
var one = int.parse('1');
assert(one == 1);

// String -> double
var onePointOne = double.parse('1.1');
assert(onePointOne == 1.1);

// int -> String
String oneAsString = 1.toString();
assert(oneAsString == '1');

// double -> String
String piAsString = 3.14159.toStringAsFixed(2);
assert(piAsString == '3.14');
```

**Bitwise operations example:**
```dart
assert((3 << 1) == 6); // 0011 << 1 == 0110
assert((3 | 4) == 7); // 0011 | 0100 == 0111
assert((3 & 4) == 0); // 0011 & 0100 == 0000
```

**Compile-time constants:**
```dart
const msPerSecond = 1000;
const secondsUntilRetry = 5;
const msUntilRetry = secondsUntilRetry * msPerSecond;
```

### Strings in Dart

A Dart `String` holds a sequence of UTF-16 code units. Use either single or double quotes to create a string:

```dart
var s1 = 'Single quotes work well for string literals.';
var s2 = "Double quotes work just as well.";
var s3 = 'It\'s easy to escape the string delimiter.';
var s4 = "It's even easier to use the other delimiter.";
```

#### String Interpolation
You can put the value of an expression inside a string using `${expression}`. If the expression is an identifier, you can skip the `{}`.

```dart
var s = 'string interpolation';

assert('Dart has $s, which is very handy.' ==
    'Dart has string interpolation, which is very handy.');
assert('That deserves all caps. ${s.toUpperCase()} is very handy!' ==
    'That deserves all caps. STRING INTERPOLATION is very handy!');
```

> [!note]
> TheÂ `==`Â operator tests whether two objects are equivalent. Two strings are equivalent if they contain the same sequence of code units.
#### String Concatenation
You can concatenate strings using adjacent string literals or the `+` operator:

```dart
var s1 = 'String '
    'concatenation'
    " works even over line breaks.";
assert(s1 ==
    'String concatenation works even over line breaks.');

var s2 = 'The + operator ' + 'works, as well.';
assert(s2 == 'The + operator works, as well.');
```

#### Multi-line Strings
Use triple quotes with either single or double quotation marks to create a multi-line string:

```dart
var s1 = '''
You can create
multi-line strings like this one.
''';

var s2 = """This is also a
multi-line string.""";
```

#### Raw Strings
Create a "raw" string by prefixing it with `r`:

```dart
var s = r'In a raw string, not even \n gets special treatment.';
```

#### Compile-time Constants
Literal strings can be compile-time constants if any interpolated expression is also a compile-time constant:

```dart
const aConstNum = 0;
const aConstBool = true;
const aConstString = 'a constant string';

const validConstString = '$aConstNum $aConstBool $aConstString';
// const invalidConstString = '$aNum $aBool $aString $aConstList'; // This won't work.
```

### Booleans in Dart

Dart uses the `bool` type for boolean values. The only two objects of this type are `true` and `false`, both of which are compile-time constants.

Dart's type safety requires explicit checks for nonboolean values:

```dart
// Check for an empty string.
var fullName = '';
assert(fullName.isEmpty);

// Check for zero.
var hitPoints = 0;
assert(hitPoints == 0);

// Check for null.
var unicorn = null;
assert(unicorn == null);

// Check for NaN.
var iMeantToDoThis = 0 / 0;
assert(iMeantToDoThis.isNaN);
```

### Runes and Grapheme Clusters

In Dart, runes expose the Unicode code points of a string. The characters package allows you to view or manipulate user-perceived characters, also known as Unicode grapheme clusters.

Use the following syntax to express Unicode code points:

```dart
// \uXXXX for 4-digit hexadecimal values.
var heart = '\u2665'; // â™¥

// \u{XXXXXX} for values with more or less than 4 digits.
var laughingEmoji = '\u{1f606}'; // ðŸ˜†
```

For working with Unicode characters, use the `characters` getter on `String` provided by the characters package:

```dart
import 'package:characters/characters.dart';

void main() {
  var hi = 'Hi ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°';
  print(hi);
  print('The end of the string: ${hi.substring(hi.length - 1)}');
  print('The last character: ${hi.characters.last}');
}
```

### Symbols in Dart

A `Symbol` object represents an operator or identifier declared in a Dart program. Symbols are useful in APIs that refer to identifiers by name, as minification changes identifier names but not symbols.

To get the symbol for an identifier, use a symbol literal:

```dart
#radix
#bar
```

Symbol literals are compile-time constants.
