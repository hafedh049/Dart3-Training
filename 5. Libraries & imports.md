### Using Libraries in Dart

#### Modular and Shareable Code
Dart's import and library directives help you create a modular and shareable code base. Libraries in Dart are not just collections of APIs; they also serve as units of privacy. Identifiers that start with an underscore (`_`) are only visible within the library in which they are declared. Every Dart file (and its parts) is a library, even if it doesn't explicitly declare a library directive.

Libraries can be distributed using packages, making them easy to share and reuse.

> [!note]
> Dart uses underscores for privacy instead of access modifier keywords like `public` or `private`. For more details, see SDK issue 33383.

#### Importing Libraries
To use the contents of one library within another, Dart provides the `import` directive.

##### Example: Importing a Library
For example, to use the `dart:html` library in a Dart web application, you would import it like this:

```dart
import 'dart:html';
```

The `import` directive requires a URI to specify the library. For built-in libraries, the URI uses the special `dart:` scheme. For other libraries, you can use a file system path or the `package:` scheme. The `package:` scheme specifies libraries provided by a package manager like the pub tool.

```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
```

> [!note]
> URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are a specific type of URI.

#### Specifying a Library Prefix
If you need to import two libraries that have conflicting identifiers, you can specify a prefix for one or both libraries to avoid name clashes.

##### Example: Using Library Prefixes
Suppose `lib1` and `lib2` both define an `Element` class. You can resolve this conflict by assigning a prefix to one of the libraries:

```dart
import 'package:lib1/lib1.dart';
import 'package:lib2/lib2.dart' as lib2;

// Uses Element from lib1.
Element element1 = Element();

// Uses Element from lib2.
lib2.Element element2 = lib2.Element();
```

#### Importing Only Part of a Library
If you only need specific parts of a library, you can selectively import what you need.

##### Example: Selective Import
You can import specific components from a library like this:

```dart
// Import only foo.
import 'package:lib1/lib1.dart' show foo;

// Import all names EXCEPT foo.
import 'package:lib2/lib2.dart' hide foo;
```

#### Lazily Loading a Library
Deferred loading (also known as lazy loading) allows a web app to load a library only when it's needed, reducing the app's initial startup time. This technique is useful for optional screens, dialogs, or A/B testing.

> [!note]
> Deferred loading is supported only in Dart web apps. Flutter uses a different mechanism for deferred loading; refer to the Flutter guide on deferred components for more details.

##### Example: Deferred Loading
To lazily load a library, import it using `deferred as`:

```dart
import 'package:greetings/hello.dart' deferred as hello;
```

When you need the library, use the `loadLibrary()` function to load it:

```dart
Future<void> greet() async {
  await hello.loadLibrary();
  hello.printGreeting();
}
```

The `await` keyword pauses execution until the library is fully loaded. You can call `loadLibrary()` multiple times, but the library will only be loaded once.

**Important Considerations:**
- Constants in a deferred library are not constants in the importing file.
- Types from a deferred library cannot be used in the importing file. Instead, consider moving shared interface types to a common library.
- The `loadLibrary()` function is automatically included in the namespace when using `deferred as`, and it returns a `Future`.

### The Library Directive

To specify library-level documentation comments or metadata annotations, attach them to a library declaration at the start of the file.

##### Example: Library Declaration
Hereâ€™s how you can declare a library with documentation and metadata:

```dart
/// A really great test library.
@TestOn('browser')
library my_test_library;
```

### Implementing Libraries
When creating packages, follow these guidelines for organizing and implementing libraries:

- **Organizing Source Code:** Structure your library's source code to be modular and easy to navigate.
- **Using the `export` Directive:** The `export` directive allows you to expose parts of your library to users while hiding internal implementation details.
- **Using the `part` Directive:** The `part` directive can split a library into multiple files.
- **Conditional Imports and Exports:** Use conditional imports and exports to support multiple platforms within a single library.

These practices help you create reusable, maintainable, and cross-platform libraries in Dart.
