### Dart Reserved Words

The following table lists words that are reserved by the Dart language. These words can't be used as identifiers in your code unless otherwise noted. Even when allowed, using keywords as identifiers can confuse other developers reading your code and should generally be avoided.

### Notes:
1. **This keyword can be used as an identifier depending on context.**
2. **This keyword can't be used as the name of a type (e.g., a class, mixin, enum, extension type, or type alias), the name of an extension, or as an import prefix. It can be used as an identifier in all other circumstances.**
3. **This keyword can be used as an identifier without restriction.**

These restrictions are in place to prevent conflicts and confusion when reading or writing Dart code. Use identifiers carefully to maintain clarity and code readability.
