### The Dart Type System

The Dart language is type safe, utilizing both static type checking and runtime checks to ensure that a variable's value always aligns with its static type, sometimes referred to as sound typing. Although types are mandatory, type annotations are optional due to type inference.

**Benefits of Static Type Checking:**

1. **Bug Detection:** Static type checking helps catch errors at compile time using Dart's static analyzer.
2. **Reduced Code Duplication:** Adding type annotations to generic classes, like `List<T>` and `Map<K, V>`, helps fix static analysis errors and improves code clarity.

**Example of Static Type Checking:**

Consider the `printInts()` function that prints an integer list and `main()` that creates a list and passes it to `printInts()`:

```dart
✗ static analysis: failure
void printInts(List<int> a) => print(a);

void main() {
  final list = [];
  list.add(1);
  list.add('2');
  printInts(list);
}
```

**Static Analysis Error:**

The code results in a type error because `list` has a static type of `List<dynamic>` (due to `var list = []`), but `printInts()` expects a `List<int>`. Assigning a non-integer value to the list results in a type mismatch.

**Fixed Code:**

```dart
void printInts(List<int> a) => print(a);

void main() {
  final list = <int>[];
  list.add(1);
  list.add(2);
  printInts(list);
}
```

Here, the type annotation `<int>` ensures type safety, allowing only integers to be added to the list.

### What is Soundness?

Soundness ensures that a program can never reach a state where an expression's value doesn't match its static type. Dart's type system enforces soundness through static checking (compile-time errors) and runtime checks. For example, assigning a `String` to an `int` is a compile-time error, while casting an object to a `String` will fail with a runtime error if it's not a `String`.

**Benefits of Soundness:**

1. **Early Bug Detection:** Reveals type-related bugs at compile time.
2. **Readability:** Code is more readable as you can trust that values have the specified types.
3. **Maintainability:** The type system helps identify issues when code changes.
4. **Efficiency:** AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation benefits from having type information, generating more efficient code.

### Tips for Passing Static Analysis

1. **Use Sound Return Types:** The return type of an overridden method must be the same type or a subtype of the return type in the superclass.

![[Pasted image 20240809121837.png]]

   ```dart
   class Animal {
     void chase(Animal a) { ... }
     Animal get parent => ...
   }

   class HoneyBadger extends Animal {
     @override
     void chase(Animal a) { ... }

     @override
     HoneyBadger get parent => ...
   }
   ```

2. **Use Sound Parameter Types:** Parameters of overridden methods must have the same type or a supertype of the corresponding parameter in the superclass. Avoid "tightening" the parameter type.

> [!note]
> If you have a valid reason to use a subtype, you can use the [`covariant` keyword](https://dart.dev/guides/language/sound-problems#the-covariant-keyword).

   ```dart
   class Animal {
     void chase(Animal a) { ... }
     Animal get parent => ...
   }

   class HoneyBadger extends Animal {
     @override
     void chase(Object a) { ... }

     @override
     Animal get parent => ...
   }
   ```

   Avoid this error:
   ```dart
   class Mouse extends Animal { ... }

   class Cat extends Animal {
     @override
     void chase(Mouse a) { ... }
   }
   ```

3. **Avoid Dynamic Lists as Typed Lists:** A dynamic list cannot be used as a typed list.

   ```dart
   void main() {
     List<Cat> foo = <dynamic>[Dog()]; // Error
     List<dynamic> bar = <dynamic>[Dog(), Cat()]; // OK
   }
   ```

### Runtime Checks

Runtime checks handle type safety issues not detectable at compile time. For example, casting a list of `Dog` to a list of `Cat` will throw an exception at runtime:

```dart
void main() {
  List<Animal> animals = <Dog>[Dog()];
  List<Cat> cats = animals as List<Cat>;
}
```

### Type Inference

Dart can infer types for fields, methods, local variables, and most generic type arguments. When inference isn't possible, `dynamic` is used.

**Example of Type Inference:**

```dart
var arguments = {'argA': 'hello', 'argB': 42}; // Inferred as Map<String, Object>
```

**Field and Method Inference:**

Fields and methods without specified types inherit types from the superclass or are inferred from initial values.

**Static Field Inference:**

Static fields get their types from their initializer but fail if there's a cycle.

**Local Variable Inference:**

Local variable types are inferred from their initializer:

```dart
var x = 3; // x is inferred as int
x = 4.0;   // Static analysis error: x was inferred as int
```

**Type Argument Inference:**

Type arguments for constructors and generic methods are inferred from context and arguments:

```dart
List<int> listOfInt = []; // Inferred as List<int>
var listOfDouble = [3.0]; // Inferred as List<double>
var ints = listOfDouble.map((x) => x.toInt()); // Inferred as Iterable<int>
```

### Substituting Types

When overriding methods or passing arguments, you can replace types based on consumer and producer rules:

1. **Consumer:** Replace with a supertype.
2. **Producer:** Replace with a subtype.

**Examples:**

**Simple Type Assignment:**

```dart
Animal c = Cat(); // Allowed
MaineCoon c = Cat(); // Not allowed
Cat c = MaineCoon(); // Allowed
```

**Generic Type Assignment:**

```dart
List<MaineCoon> myMaineCoons = [];
List<Cat> myCats = myMaineCoons; // Allowed
List<Animal> myAnimals = [];
List<Cat> myCats = myAnimals; // Not allowed
```

To fix type issues, use explicit casts:

```dart
List<Animal> myAnimals = [];
List<Cat> myCats = myAnimals as List<Cat>;
```

### Methods

When overriding methods, apply the consumer and producer rules for parameter and return types, respectively.
