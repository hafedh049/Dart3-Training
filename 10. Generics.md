### Generics

If you look at the API documentation for the basic array type, `List`, you'll see that the type is actually `List<E>`. The `<...>` notation marks `List` as a generic (or parameterized) type—a type that has formal type parameters. By convention, most type variables have single-letter names, such as `E`, `T`, `S`, `K`, and `V`.

#### Why Use Generics?

Generics are often required for type safety but offer more benefits than just ensuring your code runs correctly:

- **Better Generated Code**: Properly specifying generic types results in better-optimized code.
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Generics allow you to share a single interface and implementation between many types, reducing code duplication and taking advantage of static analysis.

For example, if you want a list to contain only strings, you can declare it as `List<String>` (read as "list of strings"). This way, you, your fellow programmers, and your tools can detect that assigning a non-string to the list is a mistake:

```dart
//✗ static analysis: failure
var names = <String>[];
names.addAll(['Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars']);
names.add(42); // Error
```

Generics let you create a single interface that can be used with different types. For instance, instead of creating multiple interfaces for different types, you can create a single generic interface:

```dart
abstract class Cache<T> {
  T getByKey(String key);
  void setByKey(String key, T value);
}
```

Here, `T` is a placeholder type that a developer will define later.

#### Using Collection Literals

List, set, and map literals can be parameterized. Parameterized literals are similar to the literals you've already seen, except that you add `<type>` (for lists and sets) or `<keyType, valueType>` (for maps) before the opening bracket. Here are some examples:

```dart
var names = <String>['Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars'];
var uniqueNames = <String>{'Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars'};
var pages = <String, String>{
  'index.html': 'Homepage',
  'robots.txt': 'Hints for web robots',
  'humans.txt': 'We are people, not machines'
};
```

#### Using Parameterized Types with Constructors

To specify one or more types when using a constructor, put the types in angle brackets (`<...>`) just after the class name. For example:

```dart
var nameSet = Set<String>.from(names);
```

The following code creates a map with integer keys and values of type `View`:

```dart
var views = Map<int, View>();
```

#### Generic Collections and the Types They Contain

Dart generic types are reified, meaning they carry their type information around at runtime. For example, you can test the type of a collection:

```dart
var names = <String>[];
names.addAll(['Seth', 'Kathy', 'Lars']);
print(names is List<String>); // true
```

> [!note] 
> In contrast, generics in Java use erasure, meaning generic type parameters are removed at runtime. In Java, you can test whether an object is a `List`, but you can't test whether it's a `List<String>`.

#### Restricting the Parameterized Type

When implementing a generic type, you might want to limit the types that can be provided as arguments, ensuring that the argument must be a subtype of a particular type. You can do this using `extends`.

A common use case is ensuring that a type is non-nullable by making it a subtype of `Object` (instead of the default, `Object?`):

```dart
class Foo<T extends Object> {
  // Any type provided to Foo for T must be non-nullable.
}
```

You can use `extends` with other types besides `Object`. For example, you can extend `SomeBaseClass`, so that members of `SomeBaseClass` can be called on objects of type `T`:

```dart
class Foo<T extends SomeBaseClass> {
  // Implementation goes here...
  String toString() => "Instance of 'Foo<$T>'";
}

class Extender extends SomeBaseClass {...}
```

It's OK to use `SomeBaseClass` or any of its subtypes as the generic argument:

```dart
var someBaseClassFoo = Foo<SomeBaseClass>();
var extenderFoo = Foo<Extender>();
```

It's also OK to specify no generic argument:

```dart
var foo = Foo();
print(foo); // Instance of 'Foo<SomeBaseClass>'
```

Specifying any non-`SomeBaseClass` type results in an error:

```dart
✗ static analysis: failure
var foo = Foo<Object>();
```

#### Using Generic Methods

Methods and functions also allow type arguments:

```dart
T first<T>(List<T> ts) {
  // Do some initial work or error checking, then...
  T tmp = ts[0];
  // Do some additional checking or processing...
  return tmp;
}
```

Here, the generic type parameter on `first` (`<T>`) allows you to use the type argument `T` in several places:

- In the function's return type (`T`).
- In the type of an argument (`List<T>`).
- In the type of a local variable (`T tmp`).
