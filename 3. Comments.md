Hereâ€™s a structured format for explaining single-line comments, multi-line comments, and documentation comments in Dart:

### Single-line Comments
A single-line comment in Dart begins with `//`. Everything after `//` on that line is ignored by the Dart compiler.

```dart
void main() {
  // TODO: refactor into an AbstractLlamaGreetingFactory?
  print('Welcome to my Llama farm!');
}
```

### Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Everything between these symbols is ignored by the Dart compiler. Multi-line comments can also nest.

```dart
void main() {
  /*
   * This is a lot of work. Consider raising chickens.
   *
   * Llama larry = Llama();
   * larry.feed();
   * larry.exercise();
   * larry.clean();
   */
}
```

### Documentation Comments
Documentation comments are special comments that are either single-line (starting with `///`) or multi-line (starting with `/**` and ending with `*/`). These comments are used to generate documentation and can reference classes, methods, fields, variables, functions, and parameters using brackets (`[]`). When the documentation is generated, the items within the brackets are turned into links to the relevant documentation.

```dart
/// A domesticated South American camelid (Lama glama).
///
/// Andean cultures have used llamas as meat and pack
/// animals since pre-Hispanic times.
///
/// Just like any other animal, llamas need to eat,
/// so don't forget to [feed] them some [Food].
class Llama {
  String? name;

  /// Feeds your llama [food].
  ///
  /// The typical llama eats one bale of hay per week.
  void feed(Food food) {
    // ...
  }

  /// Exercises your llama with an [activity] for
  /// [timeLimit] minutes.
  void exercise(Activity activity, int timeLimit) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `[feed]` becomes a link to the documentation for the `feed` method.
- `[Food]` becomes a link to the documentation for the `Food` class.

You can use Dart's `dart doc` tool to parse Dart code and generate HTML documentation. For structured documentation, refer to guidelines like *Effective Dart: Documentation*.
