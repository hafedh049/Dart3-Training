Hereâ€™s a structured explanation of using metadata annotations in Dart:

### Metadata Annotations
Metadata annotations in Dart provide additional information about your code. An annotation starts with the `@` character, followed by either a reference to a compile-time constant (like `@deprecated`) or a call to a constant constructor.

#### Built-in Annotations
Dart provides four built-in annotations that are available to all Dart code:
- `@Deprecated`
- `@deprecated`
- `@override`
- `@pragma`

##### Example: `@Deprecated` Annotation
The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to mark a part of the code as deprecated. When you use this annotation, it's recommended to specify a message to guide developers on what to use instead.

```dart
class Television {
  /// Use [turnOn] to turn the power on instead.
  @Deprecated('Use turnOn instead')
  void activate() {
    turnOn();
  }

  /// Turns the TV's power on.
  void turnOn() {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

In this example, the `activate` method is marked as deprecated, and the message advises using the `turnOn` method instead.

You can also use the `@deprecated` annotation without a message, but it's better to always specify a message with `@Deprecated` for clarity.

#### Custom Annotations
Dart allows you to define your own metadata annotations. Here's how you can define and use a custom annotation.

##### Example: Defining a Custom Annotation
You can create a custom annotation by defining a class with constant constructors.

```dart
class Todo {
  final String who;
  final String what;

  const Todo(this.who, this.what);
}
```

##### Example: Using a Custom Annotation
Once defined, you can use your custom annotation in your code like this:

```dart
@Todo('Dash', 'Implement this function')
void doSomething() {
  print('Do something');
}
```

### Where Metadata Can Be Used
Metadata annotations can be applied to various elements in your Dart code, including:
- Libraries
- Classes
- Typedefs
- Type parameters
- Constructors
- Factories
- Functions
- Fields
- Parameters
- Variable declarations
- Import or export directives

These annotations help provide additional context or instructions for the code, both for developers and tools that process the code.
